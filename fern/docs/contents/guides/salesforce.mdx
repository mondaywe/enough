#### Obtaining Salesforce Client ID and Secret

* Open a [Salesforce Developers account](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup). 
* Go to `Platform tools > Apps > App Manager`  
* Create a Salesforce Connected app, using the steps mentioned [here](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/build-a-connected-app-for-api-integration/create-a-connected-app)
  * `NOTE:` You can skip this step and use the default revert Salesforce app
* Set `https://app.revert.dev/oauth-callback/sfdc` as the `redirect` url for your app
* **Get your client\_id and client\_secret**:
  * Go to the `Platform tools > Apps > App Manager > <Name of your App> > Manage` section. 
  * Click on `Manage Consumer Details`. This will open up a Consumer Details section that gives you the `Consumer Key` (client\_id) and `Consumer Secret` (client\_secret)
  * Copy your client\_id and client\_secret
