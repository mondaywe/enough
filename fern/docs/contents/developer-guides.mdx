## System Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have the following applications and their minimum versions installed, in addition to Node.js and yarn (as mentioned earlier):

-   **Node.js 18.0.0** or later
-   **Yarn 3.0.2** or later
-   macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.

## Get Started

### Setup

-   Clone the forked repository and open the created directory

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/revert.git
cd revert

```

-   Install dependencies

```shell
yarn
```

# @revertdotdev/backend

### Copy the example env file in `packages/backend` folder.

```shell
cp packages/backend/.env.example packages/backend/.env
# Update this .env file with your own secrets if you'd like to.PgSql and redis are must.
```

### Fern setup

-   Login with Fern with `fern login`.

-   To generate Fern drive code locally, run `yarn fern` in the root folder of this repo. This will create the `packages/backend/generated` folder with the generated code.

### Fern setup fails

If `yarn fern` fails to succeed, here are some temporary solutions.

-   Try running `yarn fern` in wsl.

-   Install fern-api globally in wsl.`npm i -g fern-api` will install fern-api globally in wsl and then in the root of this project run `fern generate`.

-   Try dual booting your windows machine to ubuntu or any other linux distribution and setup the project their.

-   Try to change the internet network.For eg: if you were using mobile network,try using another mobile network/different sim and try to run `yarn fern` in wsl multiple times.

These solutions are not permanent, and there is no guarantee that they will work reliably in all situations.Order is not important,any one of them may work for you.

### Setup Redis

-   Have a redis instance running locally or use https://upstash.com/ to get a redis url.

-   Update the redis url in `.env`.A redis url looks like this `redis://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/<database>` . Use `rediss` instead of `redis` if you use a secure connection over TLS/SSL in redis.

### Setup PostgreSQL

-   Install PostgreSQL on the system before seeding the database with sample data

-   Refer https://www.postgresql.org/download/ for instructions.

-   Get a PostgreSQL url and update it in `.env` A pgsql url looks like this `postgresql://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/<database>`

### Applying Existing Migrations

-   Apply the existing migrations to sync the database with sample data with the schema.

```shell
 yarn workspace @revertdotdev/backend migration:dev
```

### Seed the database

-   Seed the database with sample data

```shell
yarn workspace @revertdotdev/backend db-seed
```

### Running the API locally

-   Backend service locally at `:4001`

```shell
yarn workspace @revertdotdev/backend dev
```

# @revertdotdev/client

### Copy the example env file in `packages/client` folder.

```shell

cp packages/client/.env.example packages/client/.env
# Update this .env file with your own secrets if you'd like to.Clerk publishable key is must.
```

### Generate a Tunnel URL

-   First, generate a tunnel URL using `ngrok http <4001 or YOUR_SERVER_PORT>`

-   Copy this URL to your clipboard as you'll need it in the next steps.

### Configure Clerk Webhook Endpoint

-   Access your Clerk dashboard (Sign up on https://clerk.com/ if you have not already).

-   Navigate to the webhook settings.

-   Ensure that the webhook endpoint is set to
    `<Tunnel_Url>/clerk/webhook`

-   Ensure that you are listening to the `user.created` event by ticking the `user`object under `Message Filtering`

### Sign Up in Your Application

-   Run `yarn dev:all` in the root of this repo(Your backend must be setup).

-   Go to `localhost:3000` and sign up.

-   In your Clerk webhook dashboard, click on your webhook endpoint,go to logs and filter by user.created and you will see a new user created.Enter inside it and copy the content.

### Testing Clerk Webhook with Postman

To verify that Clerk is sending user creation notifications to your endpoint, you can use Postman for testing.

-   Open Postman and create a new request.

-   Set the HTTP method to POST.

-   In the request's URL field, use `http://localhost:4001/clerk/webhook`. This is the endpoint Clerk will send webhook events to.

-   In the request body, paste the `user.created` object that you copied from your Clerk dashboard.
