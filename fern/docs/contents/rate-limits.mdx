### Rate Limits

Revert will return a rate limit error with the HTTP status code `429` when the request rate limit for a tenant has been exceeded.

As a default, 100 requests per minute per connection are allowed for a single tenant but if you're needs are higher please get in touch and we can tailor it to your use-case.
